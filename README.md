## Who I Am

I spent 22 years as a Combat Controller, solving high-stakes problems under real-world constraints. From remote drop zones to contested airspace, I executed with precision where ambiguity reigned. Now I bring that same clarity and logic to defense technology.

## What I Do

I’m finishing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in STEM Project Management. Every project I push reflects operational thinking fused with technical depth - an edge sharpened by field experience and mathematical discipline.

- **UAV & Embedded Systems**  
  DroneKit, ArduPilot, telemetry scripting, autonomous tasking

- **Discrete Math & Formal Logic**  
  Proof-driven code, set-based reasoning, logic structures that hold up under inspection

- **Java & C++ for Architecture and Modeling**  
  Object-oriented systems, UML-class structure, operator-level design clarity

---

## My Ethos

- **No wasted movement**: Code with purpose  
- **Design for contact**: Field-tested thinking behind every function  
- **Explain once**: Clean code is self-rescuing  

I don’t tolerate duct-taped logic.

## Current Mission

- Course Load:  
  - *Applied Linear Algebra* — matrix ops, vector spaces, systems modeling  
  - *Resource Estimating & Scheduling* — project flow, critical path logic, technical cost control

- Projects in Motion:  
  - **Proof Arena** – A tactical logic engine translating discrete math into runnable Python  
  - **Firepath** – Discrete-mapped drone routing using graph theory and edge weights  
  - **Deadman Grid** – A Boolean logic trigger matrix for autonomous failover and contingency ops  
  - **OpTempo Scheduler** – Project scheduling tool for multi-threaded execution and dynamic resourcing

These are built from the ground up - no scaffolded templates, no AI shortcuts. Just raw logic, discipline, and enough math to make it dangerous.
