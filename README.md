IDENTITY: Bradley Saucier
ROLE: Deputy Operations Manager - Anduril Industries
BACKGROUND: USAF Combat Controller (Ret.)

MISSION: Build and lead verification-first engineering teams that ship
         testable claims, auditable changes, bounded risk, and
         reproducible results.

OPERATING STANDARD: Deterministic where feasible - explicit bounds,
                   failure modes, and risk envelopes where not.

VERIFICATION SIGNAL: CI status and quality gates
                   tests (runnable)
                   traceable artifacts
```

CI STATUS:

## Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

I translate operational intent into engineering requirements and verified deliverables. If it is not testable or auditable, it is not a claim.

Standard
1. Deterministic behavior where feasible.
2. Explicit bounds, failure modes, and risk envelopes where it is not.

Output: Traceable requirements, automated verification gates, documented risk envelopes.

---

## Current Focus

1. Publishing repeatable assurance-case templates across repos (claims, evidence trails, verification steps).
2. Strengthening CI gates that survive turnover (assumptions, decision logs, reproducible runs).
3. Advancing formal methods and software security through applied coursework artifacts.

## Evidence Locker

| Field | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Pattern | Compact assurance case (CAE/GSN style): Mission, Claim, Evidence, Verify. |
| Constraint | If a repo must remain private, evidence is mirrored as sanitized docs in a public proxy repo and linked here. |

## Capabilities

| Capability | Engineering standard | Technical stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reliability under constraint | Deterministic behavior where feasible; explicit bounds and failure modes where not. | Python, C++17, Java |
| Verification and CI | Repeatable runs, automated gates, evidence trails. | GitHub Actions |
| Security evidence | Scoped claims, traceable artifacts. | Linux-first workflows |

---

## Leadership and Delivery Doctrine

1. Requirements translation - Objectives into requirements, acceptance criteria, and verification methods.
2. Risk bounded delivery - Define scope up front; document assumptions; ship within an explicit risk envelope.
3. Decision logs - Capture the why, not just the what; changes must survive turnover and audit.
4. Integration mindset - Hardware, software, and operator workflows are one system.
5. Standards - Testable claims, reproducible results, auditable changes.

## Collaboration SOP

```text
I need help with [X] in [repo]. What I tried: [Y]. Output/errors: [paste].
Constraints: [time/safety/interfaces]. Success: [definition].
```

## Background and Boundaries

I apply 22 years of USAF Combat Control operational risk management to software delivery and engineering leadership. This is personal work and does not represent any employer or agency. No proprietary, classified, sensitive, or export-controlled (ITAR or EAR) technical data is intended for publication here.
