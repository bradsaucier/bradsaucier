# [Bradley "Viper" Saucier](https://github.com/bradsaucier)  
Combat Controller (USAF, Ret.) | Building Mission‑Hardened Autonomous Systems

> "If a plan isn't hardened by logic and grit, it's a liability."

## Mission
For 22 years I brought order to chaos as a USAF Combat Controller - night jumps onto dirt strips, remote airfields, and radio traffic that couldn't wait. The arena has changed, but the standard hasn't: clear thinking, decisive execution, zero excuses. I apply that ethos at Anduril Industries while finishing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Project Management for STEM at Southern New Hampshire University (Expected Graduation: May 2026).

## Technical Focus
- **Autonomous Systems**  
  DroneKit and ArduPilot scripting in Python. Testing A* and Dijkstra planners against simulated contested airspace.

- **Formal Methods & Failsafe Design**  
  Applying TLA+ and Alloy style modeling to enumerate system states. Translating set theory and predicate logic proofs into executable pytest assertions to eliminate entire classes of bugs before deployment.

- **Robust C++ & Java Engineering**  
  UML‑driven architecture, hands‑on profiling, tight loops that can take a beating.

## Core Competencies
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Spring Boot, DroneKit, ArduPilot, NetworkX, Pytest, GoogleTest  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Docker, Gazebo Simulator, STM32, Linux  
- **Methodologies:** Formal Methods, Test‑Driven Development (TDD), UML, Agile  

## Projects in the Shop

| Project | Stack | What I'm Solving |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| **Proof Arena** | Python, pytest | Turns discrete proofs into runnable assertions so logic errors break the build, not the mission. |
| **Firepath** | Python, NetworkX, Gazebo | A* and Dijkstra routing for quadcopters through dynamic no‑fly grids. My heuristic approach reduced path calculation time by over 85 % compared to a brute‑force search in simulated high‑threat scenarios. |
| **Deadman Grid** | Modern C++ | A boolean contingency matrix guaranteeing a safe state transition in under 2 ms (tested on an STM32F4 series MCU), ensuring system stability during critical hardware or software failures. |
| **OpTempo Scheduler** | Java, Spring Boot | Gantt‑style planner that reallocates threads and resources on the fly - no more static timelines. |

## Operating Principles
- **Purposeful Code** - every line has a cost and a consequence.  
- **Clarity Is Armor** - simple logic survives contact with reality.  
- **No Technical Debt** - temporary fixes turn permanent at the worst time.  

## Contact
I prefer signal‑to‑noise ratios above 1. If you build defense tech, autonomy, or logic‑heavy systems, reach out through professional channels.
