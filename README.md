# Bradley "Viper" Saucier
Combat Controller (USAF, Ret.) | Building Mission-Hardened Autonomous Systems

> "If a plan isn't hardened by logic and grit, it's a liability."

## Mission

For 22 years I brought order to chaos as a USAF Combat Controller - night jumps onto dirt strips, remote airfields, and radio traffic that couldn't wait. The arena has changed, but the standard hasn't: clear thinking, decisive execution, zero excuses. I apply that ethos at Anduril Industries while finishing a B.S. in Computer Science.

## Technical Focus

- **Autonomous Systems**  
  DroneKit and ArduPilot scripting in Python. Testing A* and Dijkstra planners against simulated contested airspace.

- **Formal Methods & Failsafe Design**  
  Discrete-math proofs turned into unit-tested functions. Using set theory to kill bugs before they hatch.

- **Robust C++ & Java Engineering**  
  UML-driven architecture, hands-on profiling, tight loops that can take a beating.

## Projects in the Shop

| Project | Stack | What I'm Solving |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| **Proof Arena** | Python, pytest | Turns discrete proofs into runnable assertions so logic errors break the build, not the mission. |
| **Firepath** | Python, NetworkX, Gazebo | A* and Dijkstra routing for quadcopters through dynamic no-fly grids. Lesson learned: heuristics beat brute force. |
| **Deadman Grid** | Modern C++ | Boolean contingency matrix that gives an autonomous vehicle a safe state in under 2 ms on an STM32. |
| **OpTempo Scheduler** | Java, Spring Boot | Gantt-style planner that reallocates threads and resources on the fly - no more static timelines. |

## Operating Principles

- **Purposeful Code** - every line has a cost and a consequence.  
- **Clarity Is Armor** - simple logic survives contact with reality.  
- **No Technical Debt** - temporary fixes turn permanent at the worst time.  

## Contact

I prefer signal-to-noise ratios above 1. If you build defense tech, autonomy, or logic-heavy systems, reach out through professional channels.
