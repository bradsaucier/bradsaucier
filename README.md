# 🟥 Bradley “Viper” Saucier  
Retired USAF Combat Controller - E-8 - Operator-in-Transition

## Who I Am

I spent 22 years as a Combat Controller, solving high-stakes problems under real-world constraints. From remote drop zones to contested airspace, I executed with precision where ambiguity reigned. Now I bring that same clarity and logic to defense technology.

## What I Do

I’m finishing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in STEM Project Management. Every project I push reflects operational thinking fused with technical depth - an edge sharpened by field experience and mathematical discipline.

- **UAV & Embedded Systems**  
  DroneKit, ArduPilot, telemetry scripting, autonomous tasking

- **Discrete Math & Formal Logic**  
  Proof-driven code, set-based reasoning, logic structures that hold up under inspection

- **Java & C++ for Architecture and Modeling**  
  Object-oriented systems, UML-class structure, operator-level design clarity

---

## My Ethos

- **No wasted movement** - Code with purpose  
- **Design for contact** - Field-tested thinking behind every function  
- **Explain once** - Clean code is self-rescuing  

I don’t tolerate duct-taped logic.

## Current Mission

- **Course Load**  
  - *Applied Linear Algebra* - matrix ops, vector spaces, systems modeling  
  - *Resource Estimating & Scheduling* - project flow, critical path logic, technical cost control

- **Projects in Motion**  
  - **Proof Arena** - A tactical logic engine translating discrete math into runnable Python  
  - **Firepath** - Discrete-mapped drone routing using graph theory and edge weights  
  - **Deadman Grid** - A Boolean logic trigger matrix for autonomous failover and contingency ops  
  - **OpTempo Scheduler** - Project scheduling tool for multi-threaded execution and dynamic resourcing

These are built from the ground up - no scaffolded templates, no AI shortcuts. Just raw logic, discipline, and enough math to make it dangerous.

If you're operating in defense tech, autonomy, or logic-heavy systems and want to talk - you’ll know the proper channel.
