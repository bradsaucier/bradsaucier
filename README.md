> Operations leader with an engineering focus - verification-first delivery, measurable risk control, and disciplined execution in defense tech.

---

## Summary
**Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)** - I translate operational needs into engineering requirements and verified deliverables.

With 22 years managing risk and operations as a USAF Combat Controller, I bring disciplined communication, clear assumptions, and systematic risk management to software delivery. I design for deterministic behavior, auditable changes, and proof signals a reviewer can validate in CI, tests, and documentation.

---

## Current Focus
1. **Verification-first engineering** - Turn claims into checks: CI gates, tests, repeatable runs.

2. **Autonomy and assurance** - Operationalize theoretical limits: bounded demos, explicit scope, reproducible artifacts.

3. **Security posture** - Evidence-based assessments: traceable reports, verification notes, scoped findings.

## Engineered Systems

### [Autonomy and Undecidability](https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability)
**Language:** `Python` - <a href="https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability/actions/workflows/quality_gate.yml"><img alt="Build: quality-gate" src="https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability/actions/workflows/quality_gate.yml/badge.svg?branch=master" height="20" /></a>

**Purpose:** Show why universal, unbounded autonomy verification is undecidable, and what bounded assurance can prove.

**Proof signals:**
1. [Start here (context)](https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability/blob/master/start_here.md)
2. [Theory (reductions and definitions)](https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability/tree/master/theory)
3. [Tests (reproducible runs)](https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability/tree/master/tests)

### [Artemis Security Evidence](https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence)
**Language:** `Java` - <a href="https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence/actions/workflows/docs-ci.yml"><img alt="Build: docs-ci" src="https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence/actions/workflows/docs-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main" height="20" /></a>

**Purpose:** Documentation evidence package for secure software practices and dependency risk management.

**Proof signals:**
1. [Verification notes](https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence/blob/main/docs/VERIFICATION.md)
2. [Reports](https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence/tree/main/reports)
3. [Evidence artifacts](https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence/tree/main/evidence)

### [CS300 Course Planner](https://github.com/bradsaucier/CS300-CoursePlanner)
**Language:** `C++17` - <a href="https://github.com/bradsaucier/CS300-CoursePlanner/actions/workflows/ci.yml"><img alt="Build: CI" src="https://github.com/bradsaucier/CS300-CoursePlanner/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main" height="20" /></a>

**Purpose:** Deterministic CSV ingestion, prerequisite validation, lookup, and sorted catalog output.

**Proof signals:**
1. [Complexity analysis](https://github.com/bradsaucier/CS300-CoursePlanner/blob/main/docs/complexity_analysis.md)
2. [CI workflow](https://github.com/bradsaucier/CS300-CoursePlanner/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)

## Leadership and Delivery
1. **Requirements translation** - Objectives into requirements, acceptance criteria, and verification methods.

2. **Delivery tempo** - Release discipline with bounded risk and clear decision logs.

3. **Integration** - Hardware, software, and operator workflows aligned to reduce failure modes.

4. **Standards** - Testable claims, reproducible results, and auditable changes.

## Skills
| Category | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Languages** | `C++` `Python` `Java` `SQL` |
| **Focus** | Reliability, security, verification, performance under constraint |
| **Tools** | `Git` `Linux` `Docker` |
| **Methods** | TDD where it fits, explicit invariants, profiling before optimization, disciplined documentation |

## Collaboration Guidelines
1. Repo-specific - open an issue in that repository.
2. Cross-repo - open an issue in the repository that best matches the topic and link supporting artifacts.
3. Preferred issue details - context, constraints, desired outcome, definition of done, evidence.

## Operating Principles
1. High signal-to-noise ratio improves outcomes - reduce complexity, remove noise, ship only what is defensible.
2. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - automation and tests prevent rework and regression.
3. Risk is managed, not ignored - threat model, control blast radius, measure reliability.

---

## Background
USAF Combat Controller experience developed skills in high-pressure decision-making, clear communication, and systematic risk management. I apply that posture to software delivery, verification, and operations leadership.

This is personal work and does not represent any employer or agency.
