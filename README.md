IDENTITY: Bradley Saucier
ROLE: Deputy Operations Manager - Anduril Industries
BACKGROUND: USAF Combat Controller (Ret.)

MISSION: Build and lead verification-first engineering teams that ship
         testable claims, auditable changes, bounded risk, and
         reproducible results.

OPERATING STANDARD: Deterministic where feasible - explicit bounds,
                   failure modes, and risk envelopes where not.

VERIFICATION SIGNAL: CI status and quality gates
                   tests (runnable)
                   traceable artifacts
                   decision logs (ADR)
```

## Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

I translate operational intent into engineering requirements and verified deliverables. If it is not testable or auditable, it is not a claim.

Standard
1. Deterministic behavior where feasible.
2. Explicit bounds, failure modes, and risk envelopes where it is not.

Output: Traceable requirements, CI/CD quality gates, documented risk envelopes, reproducible builds.

---

## Current Focus

1. Publishing repeatable assurance-case templates (claims, evidence trails, verification steps) - see autonomy-undecidability and artemis-security-evidence.
2. Strengthening CI gates that survive turnover (assumptions, decision logs, reproducible runs) - see autonomy-undecidability quality-gate patterns.
3. Advancing formal methods and software security through applied coursework artifacts - see Evidence Locker entries.

---

## Evidence Locker

Each entry follows a compact assurance-case structure (CAE/GSN style): claim, context, evidence, and a verification path. Where supporting material cannot be published in full, it is mirrored as sanitized documentation in a public proxy repo and linked here.

## Capabilities

**Engineering:** Mission-critical delivery, secure software practices, supply chain hygiene
**Tooling:** C++20, Python, Java, SQL, GitHub Actions, CMake, Maven, Docker, Linux
**Stance:** Explicit bounds, explicit failure modes, decision logs (ADR), reproducible builds

---

## Doctrine

1. Requirements translation - objectives into requirements, acceptance criteria, and verification methods.
2. Risk-bounded delivery - define scope up front; document assumptions; ship within an explicit risk envelope.
3. Decision logs - capture the why, not just the what; changes must survive turnover and audit.
4. Simplicity under pressure - fewer moving parts, fewer failure modes. Hardware, software, and operator workflows are one system.
5. Standards - testable claims, reproducible results, auditable changes.

## Background

I apply 22 years of USAF Combat Control operational risk management to engineering work: explicit assumptions, clear acceptance criteria, and verification gates that hold up under audit. This profile focuses on personal methodology and public academic artifacts.
