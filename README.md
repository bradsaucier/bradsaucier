## BLUF
I translate operational intent into engineering constraints and verified delivery. After 22 years managing risk and tempo in austere environments, I lead operations in defense tech and build logic-heavy systems where reliability is a metric, not a hope.

## Mission
Build and lead mission-hardened software systems where correctness is engineered, tested, and repeatable.

## Leadership and Delivery
| Domain | What I do |
| --- | --- |
| Translation | Convert commander intent into requirements, acceptance criteria, and verification gates |
| Tempo | Maintain release discipline and risk controls under real operational constraints |
| Integration | Align hardware, software, and operator workflows to reduce failure modes and rework |
| Decision quality | Document assumptions, bound uncertainty, and drive measurable outcomes |
| Standards | Prefer testable claims, reproducible results, and audited changes |

## Engineered Systems
Validated logic and constraints. System names link to source.

| System | Status | Stack | Objective and proof signal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Computational Autonomy and Undecidability](https://github.com/bradsaucier/autonomy-undecidability) | Active | `Python` | Formal reasoning translated into runnable artifacts. Proof signal: executable simulation and written reductions aligned to repo docs. |
| [Artemis Security Evidence](https://github.com/bradsaucier/artemis-security-evidence) | Complete | `Java` | Security evidence package for dependency risk reduction and secure build posture. Proof signal: reports and documented rationale captured as auditable artifacts. |
| [CS300 Course Planner](https://github.com/bradsaucier/CS300-CoursePlanner) | Complete | `C++` | Advising tool with data structure tradeoffs and deterministic output. Proof signal: build instructions and sample outputs in repo. |

## Technical Inventory
| Category | Loadout |
| --- | --- |
| Languages | `C++` `Python` `Java` `SQL` |
| Engineering focus | Reliability, security, verification, performance under constraint |
| Tools and platforms | `Git` `Linux` `Docker` |
| Methods | TDD where it fits, explicit invariants, profiling before optimization, disciplined documentation |

## Operating Principles
| Operational doctrine | Engineering translation |
| --- | --- |
| Signal-to-noise wins fights | Reduce complexity, remove noise, ship only what is defensible |
| Slow is smooth, smooth is fast | Tests and automation prevent rework and regression |
| Risk is managed, not ignored | Threat model, control blast radius, measure reliability |

## Background
Combat Controller experience built my default posture: clarity under pressure, disciplined comms, and no tolerance for uncontrolled failure modes. I bring that posture to software and technical delivery.
